Created tableau dashboard on data scraped from indeed.com.  

Now that I have started looking for jobs for the role of a data analyst, to make my job hunt easy, I decided to scrape information about the job postings from the Indeed jobs website.
I wanted to know the current jobs market in this field. To get some insights, I have web scraped the Indeed jobs website for the post of Data Analyst.

This was a huge achievement as just by writing a few lines of code, I have created an excel file derived from pandas DataFrame that has the following information about 1705 job postings.

Data has the following features for each entry.
-Job role offered.
-Name of the company which is hiring.
-ratings given to the company by employees.
-Location of job.
-Time of Job posting.

To make my job hunt easy, I also have created a Tableau Dashboard that gives me insights about the jobs like
-the name of the company which is hiring.
-Location wise number of job openings plotted on the map.
-Top-rated companies.
-recent postings
-trending job roles
with just one click.
